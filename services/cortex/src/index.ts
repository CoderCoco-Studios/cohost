/**
 * cortex — the language region (prefrontal + Broca's, if you like).
 *
 * The only region that calls the chat LLM. It keeps its own working memory
 * of the conversation and waits to be told what to do:
 *   - salience says `attention.focus`  → think, then publish `brain.say`
 *   - memory answers `memory.recall.reply` and volunteers `memory.viewer`
 *   - affect says `affect.state`        → colours the prompt
 *   - the operator says `control`       → mute / say / reload personality
 *
 * It does not decide *whether* to speak and it does not remember anything
 * past the window — those are other regions' jobs. If the memory region is
 * down it simply answers without recall.
